Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers,
total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees.
Order your output by ascending company_code.

Solution:
SELECT c.company_code, c.founder, COUNT(DISTINCT(e.lead_manager_code)),
COUNT(DISTINCT(e.senior_manager_code)), COUNT(DISTINCT(e.manager_code)), COUNT(DISTINCT(e.employee_code))
FROM Company AS c
LEFT JOIN Employee AS e
ON c.company_code = e.company_code
GROUP BY c.company_code, c.founder
ORDER BY c.company_code ASC;
